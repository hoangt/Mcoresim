An in-development version of the mcoresim.



IMPORTANT
____________



Please do not check in the compiled binaries or the Makefile and the output folders. 
These are things that will be created based on the install of the OMNET++ that 
the user is running. 


ideally, after changing or adding new features and after testing them,
at the top level run a 'make clean' followed by removing the Makefile
and the 'out' folder at the top level. These are created everytime
'opp_makemake -f --deep' is run to compile the executeable binary. 

Alternatively there is a .sh script in the top level that does all
of the abovementioned steps. Run that script before doing a 'git add'
and/or 'git commit'. Compiled binaries and libraries and object files
will just add to mess up thing as and when OMNET++ improves and changes.

The OneTile.ned is a fraud network that simulates exactly one tile
or in other words a single CPU. Other than for showing little moving dots 
and what not, it is more or less nothing else.
